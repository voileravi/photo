Preprocessing prefer
- low ISO
- leave more room for post-processing
	- low contrast
	- low saturation
	- low sharpness
RAW format
- correct shutter, aperture, iso
- auto white balance to obtain right exposure
- low contrast to correctly read histogram
- high sharpness to get clear focus
- turn off high iso noise reduction to get real noise 

Photo analysis
- histogram for exposure
	- tone
		- shadow
		- highlight
	- bell distribution 
	- avoid overexposure. if happen be caution for contrasting and s-curve
- white balance
	- express mood
- sharpness
	- focus
		- show focus in adobe
		- red dots in camera

Photo modification (D)
- lens correction
	- Default preset file
	- Lens correct for batch at once
		- Distortion
		- Vignetting
	- aberration
		- auto correction
		- Droptip find aberration color to defringe
		- zoom 200%, alt + slide to view the affected area
- Transform
	- upright 
		- alt keep original picture ratio
		- level key 
	- transform
	- rotation
	- perspective
- crop

Tone and color is core for post-processing
- white balance
	- if default value in lightroom far from 0 white balance might need adjusted
	- it should be adjusted at first
- tone
	- Increase shadow and reduce highlight reduce contrast
- curve
	- point curve
	- control bright and contrast at individual tones 
- clarity
	- edge contrast  
	- middle tone contrast
	- statue photo
- saturation and vibrance
	- 0 saturation is black-white 
	- use vibrance first to avoid over saturation
	- high contrast gives good vibrance
- HSL
	- HSL is used when you want specific color
	- hue, saturation, and luminance
		- drag adjust tool

Local and details
- spot removal
	- Heal is copy and mixed with target area
	- Visualize spot check atbottom of photo
	- / key find another source area
	- Brush to define spot region to heal or copy
- adjustment brush, and gradual filter and radial filter (sht+M)
	- graduate at bottom to add another clarity, noise reduction, etc
- detail sharpness
	- sharpness 
		- zoom in 100%
		- sharpness is edge detail removal to increase contrast of two side
		- portrait low sharp, landscape high sharp 
		- more radius more detail kept
	- detail
		- detail is edge definition value, low value for clear edge
		- high detail sharpen line 
		- low detail sharpen contour
	- mask
		- low value sharpen whole picture
		- high value sharpen edge
		- good for face to avoid over sharpness
- noise reduction
	- zoom 100% to check
	- noise is up to signal brightness and sensitivity (iso)
	- especially at large dark plain area with high iso
	- first color noise reduction
	- high noise reduction value affect detail
	- noise reduction first then sharpness with mask for contours sharpness only
- color split
	- define color at shadow and highlight area
- effect

Portrait
- basic
	- low contrast and low saturation preset (adobe standard)
	- white balance
	- skin saturation reduction and brightness increase using HSL drag tool which enhance the subject  
- heal
	- skin
	- spot on hair
- whiten teeth with adjustment brush
	- teeth whiten
	- check auto mask
	- mask add (ctrl+sht+O)
- soften skin with adjust pen 
	- skin soft
	- don't check auto mask except edge 
	- reduce clarity and sharpness
- eyebag removal with spot removal (Q)
- sharpness with mask
	- alt key to see the affected area
- saturation increase with vibrance

Black and white
- set saturation to -100 to convert to black white 
- use black white panel (V) to control hue 
	- black&white mix drag tool
		- brighten skin
		- darken sky
- clarity good in black white
- bright increase to whiten teeth
- shadow bright increase for hair detail

Combine with photoshop
- outside editor
	- tiff format
	- off maximun Torrance
	- ProPhone RGB

New tricks
- intelligent
- pre defined
	- lens and camera correction
		- camera neutral
		- uncheck all
		- lens profile
		- aberration
		- version 
		- correction

Prehistory example
- upright correct perspective to upright
- use curve white and black points to change contrast according to histogram
- contrast enhance and clarity for detail
- white balance
- Black level to compensate contrast reduction
- Radial filter to add light shot effect  
- color curve drag tool for contrast 
- mask to sharpen

Garden example
- check histogram over exposure but RGB around 40%
- camera landscape as profile
- lens correction
- to get flat histogram adjust shadow and highlight to avoid over highlight and over dark
- contrast, white, dark level to adjust contrast
- color curve further increase contrast
- adjustment brush to adjust local exposure and highlight
- sharpness

Wedding example
- adobe standard profile 
- heal
- set low saturation (-40) for later process
- high white balance make skin soft and affect brightness
- reduce clarity to soften effect
- increase vibrance to compensate saturation
- adjustment brush to increase flower brightness with exposure and shadow and saturation to compensate brightness increase
- soften skin
- inverse dark edge to get dream effect
- mask to sharpen 

Landscape
- lens correction
	- level
- crop
- black&white mix (V)
- gradual filter
	- get some detail on sky
- S curve increase contrast
- clarity
- highlight low limit and shadow high limit like HDR and keep detail for sky and grasses
- Drag tool to increase grass brightness
